Identify candidate subjects and objects that match ontology domain and range types.\n    2. Locate a surface phrase that connects them and expresses the ontology relation label.\n    3. Record that phrase as the \"cue\" and quote the full supporting span that contains it.\n    4. If none is found, do not emit a triple for that relation.\n    5. Resolve simple pronouns only if doing so maintains correct domain→range typing.\n\n    Text:\n    \"The Levasseur PL.8 was a single engine, two-seat long-distance record-breaking biplane aircraft modified from an existing Levasseur PL.4 carrier-based reconnaissance aircraft produced in France in the 1920s.\"\n\n    Ontology concepts:\n    - rank\n- military rank\n- military vehicle\n- military unit\n- human\n- country\n- military casualty classification\n- armed organization\n- command\n- military museum\n- organization\n- military personnel\n- military equipment\n\n    Ontology relations (domain → range):\n    - military rank(human,military rank)\n- military branch(human,military unit)\n- military casualty classification(human,military casualty classification)\n- designed by(military equipment,organization)\n- designed by(military vehicle,organization)\n- commanded by(command,human)\n- next higher rank(military rank,rank)\n- designated as terrorist by(armed organization,country)\n- wing configuration(Q11436,)\n\n    Output JSON only in this exact schema:\n    {\n      \"triples\": [\n        {\n          \"triple\": [\"subject\",\"relation\",\"object\"],\n          \"confidence\": 0.0,  // confidence 0–1\n          \"cue\": \"matched cue phrase from text\",\n          \"support\": \"exact quoted span(s)\",\n          \"notes\": \"domain/range check; or pronoun resolution note if applied\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n\n    Rules:\n    - Extract ALL clearly stated factual triples in the text.\n    - If no relation cue appears, return an empty list of triples.\n    - Always extract any explicit date, time, or year mentioned in the text as part of a factual triple.\n    - Resolve pronouns to the nearest valid antecedent and describe that in notes.\n    - Do not invent entities that are not mentioned in the text.\n    - Output MUST be valid JSON and nothing else.\n"}, "response": {"LLM_output": "{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"triple\": [\"Levasseur PL.8\", \"designed by\", \"organization\"],\n      \"confidence\": 0.8,\n      \"cue\": \"modified from an existing Levasseur PL.4\",\n      \"support\": \"from an existing Levasseur PL.4\",\n      \"notes\": \"The text does not specify the exact organization that designed the Levasseur PL.8, but it can be inferred that it is the same organization that produced the Levasseur PL.4.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"triple\": [\"Levasseur PL.8\", \"wing configuration\", \"Q11436\"],\n      \"confidence\": 0.8,\n      \"cue\": \"a biplane aircraft\",\n      \"support\": \"a biplane aircraft\",\n      \"notes\": \"The text does not specify the exact wing configuration, but it can be inferred that it is a biplane configuration.\"\n    ]\n}", "json": null}}
