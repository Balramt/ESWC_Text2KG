Identify candidate subjects and objects that match ontology domain and range types.\n    2. Locate a surface phrase that connects them and expresses the ontology relation label.\n    3. Record that phrase as the \"cue\" and quote the full supporting span that contains it.\n    4. If none is found, do not emit a triple for that relation.\n    5. Resolve simple pronouns only if doing so maintains correct domain→range typing.\n\n    Text:\n    \"In the United States, English is the language, Asian Americans are an ethnic group and the book Alcatraz versus the Evil Librarians was written.\"\n\n    Ontology concepts:\n    - WrittenWork\n- Genre\n- Country\n- City\n- MediaType\n- Company\n- Person\n- Place\n- Organisation\n- AcademicDiscipline\n\n    Ontology relations (domain → range):\n    - numberOfPages(WrittenWork,number)\n- genre(WrittenWork,Genre)\n- capital(Country,City)\n- mediaType(WrittenWork,MediaType)\n- parentCompany(Company,Company)\n- residence(Person,City)\n- releaseDate(WrittenWork,Date)\n- headquarter(Company,City)\n- birthPlace(Person,Place)\n- impactFactor(WrittenWork,number)\n- issnNumber(WrittenWork,number)\n- isbnNumber(WrittenWork,number)\n- nationality(Person,Country)\n- abbreviation(WrittenWork,string)\n- regionServed(WrittenWork,Place)\n- affiliation(Person,Organisation)\n- oclcNumber(WrittenWork,number)\n- literaryGenre(WrittenWork,Genre)\n- libraryofCongressClassification(WrittenWork,string)\n- leaderTitle(Country,string)\n- academicDiscipline(WrittenWork,AcademicDiscipline)\n- ethnicGroup(Country,EthnicGroup)\n- firstPublicationYear(WrittenWork,Year)\n- author(WrittenWork,Person)\n- leader(Country,Person)\n- city(Company,City)\n- notableWork(Person,WrittenWork)\n- followedBy(WrittenWork,WrittenWork)\n- president(Country,Person)\n- precededBy(WrittenWork,WrittenWork)\n- doctoralAdvisor(Person,Person)\n- frequency(WrittenWork,number)\n- spokenIn(Language,Country)\n- almaMater(Person,School)\n- country(WrittenWork,Country)\n- publisher(WrittenWork,Company)\n- editor(WrittenWork,Person)\n- LCCN_number(WrittenWork,number)\n- language(WrittenWork,Language)\n- codenCode(WrittenWork,string)\n- state(City,State)\n- birthDate(Person,Date)\n- founder(Company,Person)\n- influencedBy(Person,Person)\n\n    Output JSON only in this exact schema:\n    {\n      \"triples\": [\n        {\n          \"triple\": [\"subject\",\"relation\",\"object\"],\n          \"confidence\": 0.0,  // confidence 0–1\n          \"cue\": \"matched cue phrase from text\",\n          \"support\": \"exact quoted span(s)\",\n          \"notes\": \"domain/range check; or pronoun resolution note if applied\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n\n    Rules:\n    - Extract ALL clearly stated factual triples in the text.\n    - If no relation cue appears, return an empty list of triples.\n    - Always extract any explicit date, time, or year mentioned in the text as part of a factual triple.\n    - Resolve pronouns to the nearest valid antecedent and describe that in notes.\n    - Do not invent entities that are not mentioned in the text.\n    - Output MUST be valid JSON and nothing else.\n"}, "response": {"LLM_output": "{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"triple\": [\"Alcatraz versus the Evil Librarians\", \"author\", \"not specified\"],\n      \"confidence\": 0.8,\n      \"cue\": \"was written\",\n      \"support\": \"Alcatraz versus the Evil Librarians was written.\",\n      \"notes\": \"The author is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"triple\": [\"Alcatraz versus the Evil Librarians\", \"country\", \"United States\"],\n      \"confidence\": 1.0,\n      \"cue\": \"In the United States\",\n      \"support\": \"In the United States,\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"triple\": [\"English\", \"spokenIn\", \"United States\"],\n      \"confidence\": 1.0,\n      \"cue\": \"English is the language\",\n      \"support\": \"English is the language,\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"triple\": [\"Asian Americans\", \"ethnicGroup\", \"not specified\"],\n      \"confidence\": 0.8,\n      \"cue\": \"Asian Americans are an ethnic group\",\n      \"support\": \"Asian Americans are an ethnic group\",\n      \"notes\": \"The country is not explicitly mentioned for Asian Americans.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}", "json": {"triples": [{"triple": ["Alcatraz versus the Evil Librarians", "author", "not specified"], "confidence": 0.8, "cue": "was written", "support": "Alcatraz versus the Evil Librarians was written.", "notes": "The author is not explicitly mentioned in the text."}, {"triple": ["Alcatraz versus the Evil Librarians", "country", "United States"], "confidence": 1.0, "cue": "In the United States", "support": "In the United States,"}, {"triple": ["English", "spokenIn", "United States"], "confidence": 1.0, "cue": "English is the language", "support": "English is the language,"}, {"triple": ["Asian Americans", "ethnicGroup", "not specified"], "confidence": 0.8, "cue": "Asian Americans are an ethnic group", "support": "Asian Americans are an ethnic group", "notes": "The country is not explicitly mentioned for Asian Americans."}]}}}
