Identify candidate subjects and objects that match ontology domain and range types.\n    2. Locate a surface phrase that connects them and expresses the ontology relation label.\n    3. Record that phrase as the \"cue\" and quote the full supporting span that contains it.\n    4. If none is found, do not emit a triple for that relation.\n    5. Resolve simple pronouns only if doing so maintains correct domain→range typing.\n\n    Text:\n    \"The ground for AEK Athens FC is the Olympic Stadium (Athens) in Athens whose mayor is Giorgos Kaminis.\"\n\n    Ontology concepts:\n    - SportsTeam\n- Athlete\n- Country\n- City\n- Person\n- Place\n- Demonym\n- League\n- Tenant\n- Language\n- Season\n- State\n- Ground\n- Company\n\n    Ontology relations (domain → range):\n    - club(Athlete,SportsTeam)\n- capital(Country,City)\n- fullName(Athlete,string)\n- mayor(City,Person)\n- birthPlace(Person,Place)\n- demonym(Country,Demonym)\n- champions(League,SportsTeam)\n- location(SportsTeam,Place)\n- owner(SportsTeam,Person)\n- nickname(Person,string)\n- numberOfMembers(SportsTeam,number)\n- tenant(SportsTeam,Tenant)\n- leader(Country,Person)\n- city(SportsTeam,City)\n- isPartOf(City,Country)\n- chairmanTitle(SportsTeam,string)\n- league(SportsTeam,League)\n- country(City,Country)\n- language(Country,Language)\n- season(SportsTeam,Season)\n- state(City,State)\n- ground(SportsTeam,Ground)\n- operator(SportsTeam,Company)\n- manager(SportsTeam,Person)\n\n    Output JSON only in this exact schema:\n    {\n      \"triples\": [\n        {\n          \"triple\": [\"subject\",\"relation\",\"object\"],\n          \"confidence\": 0.0,  // confidence 0–1\n          \"cue\": \"matched cue phrase from text\",\n          \"support\": \"exact quoted span(s)\",\n          \"notes\": \"domain/range check; or pronoun resolution note if applied\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n\n    Rules:\n    - Extract ALL clearly stated factual triples in the text.\n    - If no relation cue appears, return an empty list of triples.\n    - Always extract any explicit date, time, or year mentioned in the text as part of a factual triple.\n    - Resolve pronouns to the nearest valid antecedent and describe that in notes.\n    - Do not invent entities that are not mentioned in the text.\n    - Output MUST be valid JSON and nothing else.\n"}, "response": {"LLM_output": "{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"triple\": [\"AEK Athens FC\", \"location\", \"Olympic Stadium (Athens)\"],\n      \"confidence\": 1.0,\n      \"cue\": \"The ground for AEK Athens FC is the Olympic Stadium (Athens)\",\n      \"notes\": \"domain/range check: SportsTeam (AEK Athens FC) - Place (Olympic Stadium (Athens))\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"triple\": [\"Olympic Stadium (Athens)\", \"tenant\", \"AEK Athens FC\"],\n      \"confidence\": 1.0,\n      \"cue\": \"The ground for AEK Athens FC is the Olympic Stadium (Athens)\",\n      \"notes\": \"domain/range check: Ground (Olympic Stadium (Athens)) - SportsTeam (AEK Athens FC)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"triple\": [\"Athens\", \"isPartOf\", \"Country\"],\n      \"confidence\": 1.0,\n      \"cue\": \"in Athens\",\n      \"notes\": \"domain/range check: City (Athens) - Country\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"triple\": [\"Athens\", \"city\", \"Greece\"],\n      \"confidence\": 1.0,\n      \"cue\": \"in Athens\",\n      \"notes\": \"domain/range check: City (Athens) - Country (Greece)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"triple\": [\"Giorgos Kaminis\", \"mayor\", \"Athens\"],\n      \"confidence\": 1.0,\n      \"cue\": \"whose mayor is Giorgos Kaminis.\",\n      \"notes\": \"domain/range check: Person (Giorgos Kaminis) - City (Athens)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}", "json": {"triples": [{"triple": ["AEK Athens FC", "location", "Olympic Stadium (Athens)"], "confidence": 1.0, "cue": "The ground for AEK Athens FC is the Olympic Stadium (Athens)", "notes": "domain/range check: SportsTeam (AEK Athens FC) - Place (Olympic Stadium (Athens))"}, {"triple": ["Olympic Stadium (Athens)", "tenant", "AEK Athens FC"], "confidence": 1.0, "cue": "The ground for AEK Athens FC is the Olympic Stadium (Athens)", "notes": "domain/range check: Ground (Olympic Stadium (Athens)) - SportsTeam (AEK Athens FC)"}, {"triple": ["Athens", "isPartOf", "Country"], "confidence": 1.0, "cue": "in Athens", "notes": "domain/range check: City (Athens) - Country"}, {"triple": ["Athens", "city", "Greece"], "confidence": 1.0, "cue": "in Athens", "notes": "domain/range check: City (Athens) - Country (Greece)"}, {"triple": ["Giorgos Kaminis", "mayor", "Athens"], "confidence": 1.0, "cue": "whose mayor is Giorgos Kaminis.", "notes": "domain/range check: Person (Giorgos Kaminis) - City (Athens)"}]}}}
