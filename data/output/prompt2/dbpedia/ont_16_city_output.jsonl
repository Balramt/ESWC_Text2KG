Identify candidate subjects and objects that match ontology domain and range types.\n    2. Locate a surface phrase that connects them and expresses the ontology relation label.\n    3. Record that phrase as the \"cue\" and quote the full supporting span that contains it.\n    4. If none is found, do not emit a triple for that relation.\n    5. Resolve simple pronouns only if doing so maintains correct domain→range typing.\n\n    Text:\n    \"Anaheim in California is led by the US based United States House of Representatives which is part of the United States Congress.\"\n\n    Ontology concepts:\n    - City\n- CityType\n- Country\n- Demonym\n- County\n- Timezone\n- Place\n- EthnicGroup\n- GovernmentType\n- Language\n- State\n\n    Ontology relations (domain → range):\n    - type(City,CityType)\n- areaCode(City,string)\n- capital(Country,City)\n- populationMetro(City,number)\n- demonym(Country,Demonym)\n- countySeat(City,County)\n- timeZone(City,Timezone)\n- postalCode(City,string)\n- location(City,Place)\n- leaderTitle(Country,string)\n- ethnicGroup(City,EthnicGroup)\n- leader(City,Person)\n- isPartOf(City,Country)\n- areaTotal(City,number)\n- elevationAboveTheSeaLevel(City,number)\n- country(City,Country)\n- largestCity(Country,City)\n- governmentType(City,GovernmentType)\n- areaOfLand(City,number)\n- language(City,Language)\n- state(City,State)\n- utcOffset(City,number)\n- populationDensity(City,number)\n\n    Output JSON only in this exact schema:\n    {\n      \"triples\": [\n        {\n          \"triple\": [\"subject\",\"relation\",\"object\"],\n          \"confidence\": 0.0,  // confidence 0–1\n          \"cue\": \"matched cue phrase from text\",\n          \"support\": \"exact quoted span(s)\",\n          \"notes\": \"domain/range check; or pronoun resolution note if applied\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n\n    Rules:\n    - Extract ALL clearly stated factual triples in the text.\n    - If no relation cue appears, return an empty list of triples.\n    - Always extract any explicit date, time, or year mentioned in the text as part of a factual triple.\n    - Resolve pronouns to the nearest valid antecedent and describe that in notes.\n    - Do not invent entities that are not mentioned in the text.\n    - Output MUST be valid JSON and nothing else.\n"}, "response": {"LLM_output": "{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"triple\": [\"Anaheim\", \"isPartOf\", \"California\"],\n      \"confidence\": 1.0,\n      \"cue\": \"is led by\",\n      \"support\": \"Anaheim in California\",\n      \"notes\": \"City is part of Country\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"triple\": [\"Anaheim\", \"isPartOf\", \"United States\"],\n      \"confidence\": 1.0,\n      \"cue\": \"which is part of\",\n      \"support\": \"United States Congress\",\n      \"notes\": \"City is part of Country via indirect relation\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"triple\": [\"Anaheim\", \"country\", \"United States\"],\n      \"confidence\": 1.0,\n      \"cue\": \"which is part of\",\n      \"support\": \"United States Congress\",\n      \"notes\": \"City is located in Country via indirect relation\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"triple\": [\"United States House of Representatives\", \"isPartOf\", \"United States Congress\"],\n      \"confidence\": 1.0,\n      \"cue\": \"which is part of\",\n      \"support\": \"United States Congress\",\n      \"notes\": \"GovernmentType is part of GovernmentType\"\n    }\n  ]\n}", "json": {"triples": [{"triple": ["Anaheim", "isPartOf", "California"], "confidence": 1.0, "cue": "is led by", "support": "Anaheim in California", "notes": "City is part of Country"}, {"triple": ["Anaheim", "isPartOf", "United States"], "confidence": 1.0, "cue": "which is part of", "support": "United States Congress", "notes": "City is part of Country via indirect relation"}, {"triple": ["Anaheim", "country", "United States"], "confidence": 1.0, "cue": "which is part of", "support": "United States Congress", "notes": "City is located in Country via indirect relation"}, {"triple": ["United States House of Representatives", "isPartOf", "United States Congress"], "confidence": 1.0, "cue": "which is part of", "support": "United States Congress", "notes": "GovernmentType is part of GovernmentType"}]}}}
