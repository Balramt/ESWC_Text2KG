Identify candidate subjects and objects that match ontology domain and range types.\n    2. Locate a surface phrase that connects them and expresses the ontology relation label.\n    3. Record that phrase as the \"cue\" and quote the full supporting span that contains it.\n    4. If none is found, do not emit a triple for that relation.\n    5.
